longest common substring


longest common subsequence


minimum deletions at any index to make palindromw  = len - (length of common subsequence(s1,s2))  s2 = rev(s1)

minimum addtions = minimum deletions to make a palindrome

minimum addtions at starting to make a string palindrome = len-longestpalindrome(when j = len-1
